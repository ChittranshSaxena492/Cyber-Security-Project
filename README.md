# 🔐 Cyber Security Project – OWASP Top 10 & DVWA Testing

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the practical application of web application security concepts, focusing on the **OWASP Top 10** vulnerabilities. It also includes **manual testing** of vulnerabilities using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** and tools like **Burp Suite**.

## 📁 Contents
- ✅ **OWASP Top 10 Summary**  
  Brief description of each vulnerability with real-world examples.
  
- 🧪 **Testing XSS & SQL Injection on DVWA**  
  Demonstrates basic attacks like cross-site scripting and SQL injection, including payloads and results.

- 🧼 **Input Validation & Secure Coding**  
  PHP and JavaScript examples showing vulnerable code and secure fixes.

- 🌐 **Security Headers & HTTPS Setup**  
  Analysis and secure configuration of HTTP security headers using Apache.

- 🛡️ **Basic WAF Rule (ModSecurity)**  
  Example rule to block SQLi patterns using ModSecurity.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **DVWA** – Testbed for vulnerable web apps  
- **Burp Suite** – Interception and injection testing  
- **Apache** – Security header configuration  
- **ModSecurity** – Basic web application firewall rule

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities  
- Hands-on testing of XSS and SQLi attacks  
- Secure coding practices in PHP and JavaScript  
- Web server hardening with security headers  
- Basic WAF rule writing and testing

## 📎 How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install DVWA and set security level to "Low"  
3. Use Burp Suite to test XSS and SQLi payloads  
4. Refer to the `Project Cyber Security.pdf` for detailed explanations and configurations
